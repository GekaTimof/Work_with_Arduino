## Description of how the circuit works
When you run the script, a percentage scan counter will appear on the screen, 
slowly move a flat vertical object away from the camera, 
gradually the percentage will increase. 
When it exceeds 90, an equation will appear on the screen reflecting
the dependence of the laser sensor readings on the distance 
(there will also be real data on the graph for comparison).
