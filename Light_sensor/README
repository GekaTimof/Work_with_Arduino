When you turn off the circuit, it will work automatically.
It have 2 lights and 2 sensors on one side.

How to use it:
After turning on the circuit, twist it slightly to the left or to the right -> lights turn on.

One light is blinking - it meen that you need to turn circuit to this way.
Two lights are on - it meen that youe already turned sensors directly to the light
