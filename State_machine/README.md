## Description of how the circuit works
When you turn off the circuit, it will work automatically.

You can switch it to manual mode by sending command "t2", 

Then you can use command "1" to turn on the green light 
and 
command "2" to turn on the red light. 

The scheme for returning to automatic mode after 1 minute 
or 
after receiving a command is “t1”.
